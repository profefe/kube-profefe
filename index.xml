At the moment it serves two different binaries:
kubectl-profefe a kubectl plugin that helps you to caputre pprof profiles, storing them locally or in pprofefe. It uses port-forwarding to expose the pprof port locally. kprofefe is a cli that you can run as a cronjob in your kubernetes cluster. It discovers running pods in your clusters, it downloads profiles and it pushes them in profefe.</description></item><item><title>Getting Started with kprofefe</title><link>/docs/getting-started-with-kprofefe/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/getting-started-with-kprofefe/</guid><description>Goal The end goal here is to deploy everything in kubernetes, and to get profiles pushed from our pod into profefe.
Prerequisites Have a Kubernetes cluster up and running Deploy profefe inside or outside your Kubernetes cluster. But it has to be reachable from the Kubernetes cluster network. I will assume that the URL for it is https://profefe.internal.company.com:10100 You should have the kubectl profefe plugin already installed (checkout the installation doc) Getting Started Find a candidate We have to find a good first candidate, a pod that runs an application that exposes the pprof handler.</description></item><item><title>Installation</title><link>/docs/installation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/installation/</guid><description>This project is made of two components. A kubectl plugin and the collector.
You can download both of them from the release page via GitHub.
kubectl profefe The kubectl plugin usually runs from your laptop, and it is built for multiple platforms: Linux, Mac.
Install via Krew krew is a package manager for kubectl plugins and you can use it to install kube-profefe:
kubectl krew install profefe
kprofefe The collector called kprofefe usually runs as a cronjob in Kubernetes.</description></item><item><title>Developing</title><link>/docs/developing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/developing/</guid><description>This project is written in Go and it uses go module as a dependency manager.
The tool chain I use is very simple and it does not require anything more than what Go requires.
$ go build cmd/kprofefe
$ go test ./...
$ go vet ./...
And so on.
Delivery This project is in continuous delivery and it uses GoReleaser with GitHub Actions.
Every time a new tag is pushed the CI runs GoReleser.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/about/</guid><description>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
